User: Hey
Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?
User: Write me a hello world in swift and rust
Bot: Sure! Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in Swift:

```swift
print("Hello, World!")
```

And here is the same program in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

Both programs will output "Hello, World!" when executed. Let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!
User: exit
Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
