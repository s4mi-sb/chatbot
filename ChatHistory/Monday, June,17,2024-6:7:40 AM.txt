User: how to solve the anagram problem in go?
Bot: One way to solve the anagram problem in Go is to first sort the characters of both words and then compare them to see if they are equal. Here is an example code that demonstrates this approach:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"
    "strings"
)

func isAnagram(word1, word2 string) bool {
    // Convert the words to lowercase for case insensitivity
    word1 = strings.ToLower(word1)
    word2 = strings.ToLower(word2)

    // Sort the characters of both words
    word1Sorted := sortString(word1)
    word2Sorted := sortString(word2)

    // Compare the sorted words
    return word1Sorted == word2Sorted
}

func sortString(w string) string {
    s := strings.Split(w, "")
    sort.Strings(s)
    return strings.Join(s, "")
}

func main() {
    word1 := "listen"
    word2 := "silent"

    if isAnagram(word1, word2) {
        fmt.Printf("%s and %s are anagrams\n", word1, word2)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("%s and %s are not anagrams\n", word1, word2)
    }
}
```

In this code, the `isAnagram` function takes two words as input, converts them to lowercase, sorts the characters of both words, and then compares them to check if they are equal. If the sorted words are equal, then the input words are anagrams.
